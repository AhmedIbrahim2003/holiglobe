            <h2>History of Chinese New Year</h2>
            <p>

                Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, has a
                storied history dating back over 3,000 years. Its origins trace
                to the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) when people celebrated
                the lunar new year as an agricultural festival. Over time, it
                evolved into a more formalized event during the Han Dynasty (202
                BCE–220 CE), with activities like ancestor worship and the use
                of firecrackers to ward off evil spirits. The adoption of the
                lunar calendar by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty solidified the
                festival's connection to the cycles of the moon. While its
                traditions have evolved, Chinese New Year remains deeply rooted
                in ancient customs, continuing to be one of the most significant
                and widely celebrated festivals in Chinese culture.
