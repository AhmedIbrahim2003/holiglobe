            <p>Brazil, officially known as the Federative Republic of Brazil is the biggest country in South America in terms of landmass and population.

                Brazil is the fifth-largest in the world both in terms of area and population. Spanning an area between central South America and the Atlantic Ocean, it is the Easternmost country of America. Brazil borders every other South American country apart from Ecuador and Chile.
                
                During the expansion by Europe into the new world, Brazil was colonised by Portugal, and as a result, it is the only Portuguese-speaking country in the Americas. It has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.

        <p>
            The revolution that transformed Brazil into a republic was so uneventful that the few witnesses present didn't know it happened and the dethroned Emperor didn't even care.
